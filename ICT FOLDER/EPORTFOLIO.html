We call ourselves the homosapiens! We all met each other in grade 8 and got to be close with each other in a group activity for english which we had to make a song for teachers day. At first, we were pretty distant with each other and most of us didnt expect we would be friends with one another, but as time flew by we got closer and closer with each other. Theyre the friends that I trust and I know I can count on whenever i need them. I can say many more words to appreciate each and everyone of these people, my second family, and the group i truly love the most. </p> <br><!this is an image--><h2 class="snake"> My family </h2><p class="dog"> I give all my love and appreciation to my parents who have always been there to support me in every step of my journey. My family, although not prefect will always be a place i know i can rest in. Even though we may argue sometimes, i still love and care for the so much. I am truly grateful for my family, for not only looking after me but treating me to the best of their ability. </p> <br></body></html>
